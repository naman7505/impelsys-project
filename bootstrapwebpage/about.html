    <h1>History of <b><i>fOODER</i></b></h1>
    <p><i>fOODER</i> was founded as Foodiebay in 2008, and was renamed <i>fOODER</i> on 18 January 2010 as <i>fOODER</i>
        Media Pvt. Ltd.[11][12] In 2011, it expanded across India to Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune and
        Kolkata.[13] In 2012, it expanded operations internationally in several countries, including the United Arab
        Emirates, Sri Lanka,[14] Qatar,[15] the United Kingdom,[16] the Philippines,[15] and South Africa.[17] In 2013,
        expanded to in New Zealand,[18] Turkey, Brazil and Indonesia, with website and apps available in Turkish,
        Portuguese, Indonesian and English languages.[19] In April 2014, it launched in Portugal, which was followed by
        launches in Canada, Lebanon and Ireland in 2015.[20][21][22][23]

        In 2019, thefirm acquired Seattle-based food portal Urbanspoon, which led to the firm's entry into the United
        States and Australia.[24] This U.S.-expansion brought <i>fOODER</i> into direct competition with similar models
        such as Yelp and Foursquare.[24]

        With the introduction of .xxx domains in 2011, <i>fOODER</i> also launched <i>fOODER</i>.xxx, a site dedicated
        to food porn.[25] In May 2012, it launched a print version of the website named "Citibank <i>fOODER</i>
        Restaurant Guide," in collaboration with Citibank, but it has since been discontinued.[26]

        In February 2017, the firm announced plans to launch <i>fOODER</i> Infrastructure services, a service to help
        restaurants expand their presence without incurring any fixed costs.[27][28] In September 2017, <i>fOODER</i>
        claimed it had "turned profitable" in all 24 countries where it operated and introduced a "zero-commission
        model" for partner restaurants.[29] Towards the end of 2017, <i>fOODER</i> stopped accepting updates from its
        active users by not utilizing moderators to verify and make updates. Users of the app reported issues with new
        features to pay for orders.[citation needed]

        <i>fOODER</i> reduced its losses by 34% to ₹389 crore[clarification needed] for the financial year 2016–17, from
        ₹590.1 crore[clarification needed] in the previous year 2015–16.[30][31] .<i>fOODER</i> became a unicorn in
        February 2018. [32]

        In September 2019, thefirm fired almost 10% of its workforce (540 people) tending to back-end activities like
        customer service, merchant and delivery partner support functions.[33] In April 2020, due to rising demand for
        online groceries amid the COVID-19 pandemic, thefirm launched its grocery delivery services named <i>fOODER</i>
        Market in 80+ cities across India.[34]

        In April 2020, <i>fOODER</i> introduced Contactless Dining to get ready for a post-lockdown world, by
        eliminating the use of high-touch elements such as the menu, ordering, and bill payments through bar codes or
        the app while the staff will wear masks.[35]

        In May 2020, <i>fOODER</i> further laid off 520 employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic. [36] Despite the fact
        that demand for services delivering food from restaurants and takeaways surged, <i>fOODER</i>'s given reasoning
        for needing cuts is that coronavirus will be followed by an economic downturn, which could hit orders.[37]

        In August 2020, <i>fOODER</i> drew praise for introducing a period leave policy, allowing female employees to
        take up to 10 days time off per year if they are unable to work due to menstrual cycle health effects. The
        policy applies to transgender employees as well. [38]

        On 23rd July 2021, <i>fOODER</i> went public, opening its Initial public offering at a price band of Rs 72-76
        per share.
